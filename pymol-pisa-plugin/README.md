# PyMOL PISA Plugin

## Overview
The PyMOL PISA Plugin is a tool designed to facilitate the analysis of interactions between receptor and ligand molecules within the PyMOL molecular visualization system. This plugin provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to easily perform interaction analyses and visualize results directly in PyMOL.

## Features
- Analyze various types of molecular interactions, including hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, hydrophobic interactions, and more.
- Visualize interactions in PyMOL with customizable representations.
- Save interaction results to a text file for further analysis.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pymol-pisa-plugin.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd pymol-pisa-plugin
   ```
3. Install the plugin using the setup script:
   ```
   python setup.py install
   ```

## Usage
1. Launch PyMOL.
2. Load the plugin:
   ```
   run /path/to/pymol-pisa-plugin/src/gui.py
   ```
3. Use the GUI to select receptor and ligand molecules, set parameters for interaction analysis, and visualize results.
